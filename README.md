# Bubble Game ðŸŽ¯

Bubble Game is a fun and interactive game built using **React** and **CSS**, where the player clicks on randomly generated bubbles within a set time limit to score points. The goal is to hit the target number and maximize your score before the timer runs out.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Click on bubbles displaying random numbers. Each correct hit increases your score, while a wrong hit decreases it.
- **Dynamic Bubbles**: The bubbles regenerate after each hit, providing fresh targets to keep the game exciting.
- **Timer Countdown**: A 60-second countdown timer challenges players to score as many points as possible before the time runs out.
- **Score Tracking**: Real-time score tracking based on correct and incorrect clicks.
- **Game Control**: Start, pause, and resume the game at any time during play.
- **Game Over Screen**: A final screen displays the player's score once the timer reaches zero.

## How to Play

1. Click on the "Start Game" button to begin.
2. A target number will be displayed in the **Hit** box.
3. Click the bubbles that match the target number to score points:
   - **Correct Hit**: +10 points.
   - **Wrong Hit**: -10 points.
4. The game ends when the timer reaches zero, and your final score will be displayed.
